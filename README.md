# ROM-organize-o-matic
A jar which sorts ROMs by alphabetical order

## Important
**All ROMs must be in the root folder you select**. The jar won't sort ROMs in subdirectories.

## Usage
Execute the jar (java might be required if not installed). Click on "Select folder..." and choose the folder where you have your ROMs, click on "Separate alphabetically" and wait.
